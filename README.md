# ðŸ§  Prompt Engineering Projects

This repository is a growing collection of structured prompt systems Iâ€™ve designed to solve real problems in my own life â€” from decision-making and job hunting to offer creation and productivity.

Each prompt is built around a specific use case where traditional tools fell short. I use structured logic, probabilistic thinking, and modular workflows to automate or improve how I think, decide, and act.

## ðŸ§© Why I Built These

| Prompt Name                | Why It Exists |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Strategic Logic OS**    | I needed a system to help me think clearly when overwhelmed. This prompt acts like a logical, supportive assistant â€” it asks what I want, helps me guess the next best move, ranks those guesses by probability and leverage, and holds me accountable to execute. Itâ€™s built to help me make faster, smarter decisions and track my progress without emotional fog. |
| **Job Search Prompt**     | Job hunting was wasting too much of my time. I built this to cut through the noise â€” it curates high-quality, relevant jobs with keywords and links, so I can focus only on applying. It compresses hours of job board browsing into minutes. |
| **Market Research Prompt**| I wanted to create a $1K offer quickly â€” but not a feel-good, "sounds nice" offer. This prompt walks through the entire pipeline: find a niche â†’ extract pain points â†’ filter high-value problems â†’ propose specific solutions. It helps me validate demand logically before I ever build anything. |

More systems coming soon â€” every time I hit a bottleneck, I try solving it with a prompt first.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each folder is an independent prompt system.

Inside each:
- `prompt.json`: the actual structured prompt
- `README.md`: how it works, what problem it solves, and usage tips
