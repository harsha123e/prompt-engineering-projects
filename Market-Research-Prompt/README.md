# Market Research Prompt 📊

A structured prompt system designed to generate and validate high-value offers by automating niche selection, pain point discovery, and solution ideation — ideal for solopreneurs, creators, and indie hackers.

## 🎯 What It Does

The **Market Research Prompt** helps you go from vague ideas to validated $1K+ offers by logically walking through:

1. Who you want to serve (niche targeting)
2. What they're struggling with (pain points)
3. Which problems are valuable (filter by urgency & willingness to pay)
4. What solutions you could offer (based on demand, not guesswork)

It’s like having a structured co-founder who thinks in terms of logic, leverage, and buyer psychology.

## ✅ Use Cases

- You want to create a digital product or service that people actually need  
- You’re validating a $1K+ offer idea before building  
- You’re stuck between too many niches or ideas  
- You want a repeatable market research process powered by AI  

## 🧠 What It Solves

Most people create "feel-good" offers — things that sound cool but don’t sell. This prompt flips that by using a pipeline that simulates real market research:

- No more guessing what to build  
- No more vague brainstorming  
- No more wasted weeks validating an idea  

You get:
- Laser-targeted niches  
- Concrete pain points (with emotional and financial angles)  
- Problem-value rankings  
- Solution blueprints you can test or launch

## 💡 How It Works

1. Input broad topic(s) or interests.
2. The prompt proposes niche audiences.
3. It extracts real pain points using empathy + data patterns.
4. You filter for urgency, willingness to pay, and ease of solution.
5. The system outputs validated offer ideas with market reasoning.

### Example Use Case

**Niche:** Online coaches struggling with lead generation  
**Pain Point:** Wasting hours on Instagram content with little ROI

## 📈 Why I Built This

I wanted to create a $1K offer quickly — but I didn’t want to build something no one asked for.

This prompt became my research partner. It helped me:
- Think clearly about market gaps  
- Filter bad ideas early  
- Gain momentum without overthinking  

Now I use it anytime I want to create something that’s **actually useful**.

## 🚀 How To Use It

- Paste the prompt into ChatGPT or your preferred LLM.
- Start with a broad topic or niche.
- Follow the step-by-step prompts for niche → problem → validation → offer.
- Rerun or tweak to explore different angles.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Use the output to write your landing page or outreach messages directly.
