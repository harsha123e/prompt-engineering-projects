Market Research Prompt 📊
A structured prompt system designed to generate and validate high-value offers by automating niche selection, pain point discovery, and solution ideation — ideal for solopreneurs, creators, and indie hackers.
🎯 What It Does
The Market Research Prompt helps you go from vague ideas to validated $1K+ offers by logically walking through:

Who you want to serve (niche targeting)
What they're struggling with (pain points)
Which problems are valuable (filter by urgency & willingness to pay)
What solutions you could offer (based on demand, not guesswork)

It’s like having a structured co-founder who thinks in terms of logic, leverage, and buyer psychology.
✅ Use Cases

You want to create a digital product or service that people actually need  
You’re validating a $1K+ offer idea before building  
You’re stuck between too many niches or ideas  
You want a repeatable market research process powered by AI

🧠 What It Solves
Most people create "feel-good" offers — things that sound cool but don’t sell. This prompt flips that by using a pipeline that simulates real market research:

No more guessing what to build  
No more vague brainstorming  
No more wasted weeks validating an idea

You get:

Laser-targeted niches  
Concrete pain points (with emotional and financial angles)  
Problem-value rankings  
Solution blueprints you can test or launch

📈 Why I Built This
I wanted to create a $1K offer quickly — but I didn’t want to build something no one asked for.
This prompt became my research partner. It helped me:

Think clearly about market gaps  
Filter bad ideas early  
Gain momentum without overthinking

Now I use it anytime I want to create something that’s actually useful.
