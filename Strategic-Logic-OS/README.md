# Strategic Logic OS 🧠

A structured decision-making prompt system designed to help you think clearly, act strategically, and track your progress — especially when you're overwhelmed, stuck, or unsure what to do next.

## 🧩 What It Does

**Strategic Logic OS** acts like a logical accountability partner. It asks what you want, helps you generate and prioritize your next best move, and holds you accountable to take action — using clear logic, probabilities, and leverage.

Whether you're battling indecision, juggling too many tasks, or stuck in loops of avoidance, this prompt brings clarity through structure.

## ✅ Use Cases

- Overwhelmed by too many priorities?  
- Avoiding important tasks?  
- Unsure what action will move the needle most?  
- Making emotional or impulsive decisions?  
- Struggling to finish what you start?

Strategic Logic OS helps you debug your day-to-day thinking — like you're troubleshooting faulty code — so you can make smarter decisions with less emotional fog.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Vent Freely** → Share what's on your mind.  
2. **Problem Selection** → Identify the most urgent issue.  
3. **Energy Check** → Match action difficulty to your energy level.  
4. **Prioritization** → Estimate the leverage and success probability of your next move.  
5. **Accountability Loop** → Get logical nudges and structured check-ins.
6. **Weekly Review & Meta Reflection** → Identify patterns, blind spots, and system tweaks.

## 📈 Why I Built This

I found myself wasting time, second-guessing decisions, and constantly switching tasks. I needed a system that would challenge my logic, surface blind spots, and keep me focused on high-leverage actions — especially when willpower was low.

**Strategic Logic OS** became my daily mental operating system.

## 🚀 How To Use It

- Paste the `prompt.json` into your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
- Answer the check-in questions honestly.
- Let the system help you prioritize and track your momentum.

> Tip: Set recurring reminders (daily or weekly) to run this prompt for consistent results.
