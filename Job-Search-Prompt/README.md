# Job Search Prompt 🔍

⚠️ Disclaimer: This prompt only fetches publicly available job listings. Platforms requiring login or dynamic content (like LinkedIn) may not be fully supported.
Treat this as a discovery aid, not a complete job board replacement.

A structured AI prompt system that automates your job search by curating remote job listings tailored to your skills, preferences, and keywords — saving hours of manual work across job boards.

## 🎯 What It Does

The **Job Search Prompt** replaces hours of scrolling and filtering with a single curated list of high-quality, relevant job listings. You define your target roles, keywords, and sources — and the prompt returns ready-to-apply jobs with all the key details.

It’s like a personal job search assistant built entirely inside a prompt.

## ✅ Use Cases

- You're applying to remote QA, Virtual Assistant, or Customer Support roles.
- You want to avoid duplicate listings and expired job posts.
- You want to apply faster instead of wasting time on job board browsing.
- You want a repeatable, structured workflow for job hunting.

## 🧠 What It Solves

Manual job searching is:
- Time-consuming  
- Repetitive  
- Emotionally draining  

This prompt gives you:
- Fresh, relevant jobs across multiple boards  
- Keyword-based filtering  
- Curated results in Markdown format (with links, salary info, source)  
- A systemized way to track applied/saved/skipped statuses  

## ⚙️ Files

- `prompt.json`: The full structured prompt (compatible with ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, or any LLM that supports multi-step reasoning).
- `README.md`: You’re reading it.

## 💡 How It Works

1. Define your **target roles** and **keyword sets**.
2. Choose international and/or India-based job boards.
3. Set filters like remote-only, language preference, date posted, etc.
4. The system fetches, deduplicates, tags, and returns a formatted job list.
